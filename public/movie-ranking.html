<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>The Pulse</h3>
<p>A terrific horror movie that isn't really a horror movie.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>An amazing and beautifully animated superhero movie that plays like a comic book.</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>A clever exploration of the world of dreams. Granted me a much deeper appreciation for cinema as a form of art.</p>
